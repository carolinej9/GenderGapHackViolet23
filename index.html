		 <h3>About the Gap<hr></h3>
		  <p>&#128073 The gender gap in tech is a current issue that concerns fair gender representation in the industry. There are many barriers, including level and quality of education, chances of promotion, and salary gap. Another issue is that many women have expressed interest in the technology field, however there are not many role models to fully support and lead.
      <br>
      <br>&#128204 One solution would be to <mark>introduce more STEM classes and opportunities</mark> to women at a younger age through academic classes or engaging extracurriculars. This would lead to more girls being introduced to STEM applications and promote interest in fields where they might not have previously considered. 
      <br>
      <br>&#128273 Another change would be to <b>bring in notable women</b> in positions of leadership to young women in order to motivate them to pursue a similar future in tech. Learning about their experiences will also allow them to gain insightful tips and tricks in their journey of navigating the tech industry as a woman.
